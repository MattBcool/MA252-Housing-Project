The purpose of this paper is to identify which variables have the largest influence on house value in the United States and to create a multiple linear regression model to predict house value. Using the 2019 data from IPUMS, we found that age of structure, metropolitan status, number of bedrooms, log value of property tax, and state all have significant effect on the dependent house value variable. State and property tax were two of the most significant predictors within the model. 

These results indicate possible correlation between location and house value as states and counties within those states have varying property taxes based on population size and density in the region. Age of structure was also a good predictor of home value but we believe that it could be skewed in more wealthy areas where older built homes could be renovated and upgraded. This could introduce bias into the reporting of home value as the owner gave an estimate of what they believe their house is worth. Since the housing market is constantly changing with increasing inflation from COVID-19, it is important that more research is conducted to test for other variables that could affect home price to make extrapolation into the future more accurate.
