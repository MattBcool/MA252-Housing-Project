\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}


A multiple linear regression model was used with house value as the response variable. We tested 5 possible models by using the same 5 explanatory variables examined in the \textbf{variables} section but with different selection procedures and criteria. We took the natural log of property tax and predicted value in order to increase the r-squared value while decreasing variance. This means that we will be predicting the log value of a house with the final model. The step wise procedure was used for the first three models where the different selection criteria values of BIC, CP Mallow, and p-value were used. For the other two models, we took the selection criteria that had the best fit from the first three models (p-value) and used it with the forward selection procedure and then the backward selection procedure. We chose this process as a way to standardize selection procedure and predictor variables which allowed for comparison of the multiple model's ability to predict house price.
